## Contributing and Collaboration

I would love to hear from you! Issues or pull requests work great. Both a [Matrix space][matrix] and [Discord][discord] are available for live help, but I have a strong bias towards answering in the form of documentation. You can also find me on [the web](https://www.massicotte.org).

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
